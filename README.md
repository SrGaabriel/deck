# ðŸŽ² deck [WIP]

This is the official bot API deck implementation, which is still in an early and experimental phase. We'll be adding and implementing features according to the API rhythm.

## Example

Deck has a really powerful API, here is an example:

```kotlin
suspend fun main() {
    val client = DeckClient("token")
    client.on<MessageCreateEvent> {
        if (!message.content.startsWith("+hello"))
            return@on
        val message: Message = channel.sendMessage("Hello, World!")
        message.sendReply("Hello, this is a reply!")
    }
    client.login()
}
```

## Using

To use deck in your project, you must have the `jitpack` repository added. Then, you're going to add the following dependency to your build file: `com.github.SrGaabriel.deck:deck-core:$version`.

You can replace `deck-core` with the name of the module you wish to import, and for the version you may ues the latest one:

}

    implementation("com.github.SrGaabriel.deck:deck-core:$version")
}
```
